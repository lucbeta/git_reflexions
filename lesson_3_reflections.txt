When would you want to creat a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To backup the work, be accessible from different location and have exposure to the public for the code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because I can not be sure what kind of code is on remote. It seems better to check first and then pull the changes if desired manually.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks allow remote repos to copy and use whitout changing the original repo. It is a remote clone of a repo. 
With clones one can copy a remote repo locally. 'A branch in Git is [...] a lightweight pointer to one of given commits[,]'
which allows multiple lines of development.
